# SoundTag

NFC-triggered, multi-device audio playback server — play sounds on multiple phones with a single tag and no apps required.

![NFC demonstration](nfc_final_ripple_demo.gif)

## Overview

SoundTag lets you tap an NFC tag on one or more phones (iPhone and Android). Each phone opens a blank white listener page and, after a single tap to unlock audio, stays connected to a central audio stream. You control that stream from a simple web control panel where you can upload sounds, tap a file name to play it, or stop playback (which makes the stream go silent without disconnecting listeners).

## Features

- **No mobile apps needed** – uses browsers and standard NFC to open the listener page.
- **Works on multiple devices** – all connected phones hear the same audio at once.
- **Simple control panel** – upload audio files and tap their names to play them.
- **Stop = silence** – stop playback without disconnecting listeners.
- **Cross‑platform** – supports iPhone (iOS 13+), Android, Windows, macOS and Linux.
- **MIT licensed** – build on it freely.

## What SoundTag cannot do

- It cannot change system volume, bypass mute mode or play audio without a user tap (these are OS restrictions on iOS and Android).
- It does not run in the background once the listener page is closed.

## Quick install

You need Node.js and ffmpeg installed. The install scripts create a `soundtag` folder, install dependencies and start the server.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soundtag1/soundtag/main/install/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

RUN COMMANDS 1 BY 1!!!

```powershell
cd $env:TEMP
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soundtag1/soundtag/main/install/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

Alternatively, download and double‑click `install/install.bat`.

## Using SoundTag

1. Install and run the server using the commands above.
2. Expose port 3000 on your network. For internet access you can port‑forward 3000 or use a tunnel service such as playit.gg.
3. Program your NFC tag (or a QR code) to open:

   ```
   https://your-public-url/listener
   ```

   This is the blank white listener page. Tapping once on this page unlocks audio.

4. Open the control panel at:

   ```
   https://your-public-url/control
   ```

   Upload one or more `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg` or `.m4a` files. Each file appears as a tappable row.

5. Tap a file name in the control panel to broadcast it to all connected phones.
6. Press **Stop (Silent)** to make the audio stream go silent while keeping listeners connected.
